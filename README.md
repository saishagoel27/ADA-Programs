Solves the problem of filling a knapsack (bag) with items to maximize value, where you can take fractions of items.

**Real-world analogy:**  
Like packing a suitcase with items of different values and weights. You can break items (like gold bars) into smaller pieces to maximize the total value while staying under the weight limit.

**Algorithm Used:** Greedy approach

**Algorithm Used:** Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

**How it works:**
1. Start with direct distances between vertices
2. For each vertex k, check if going through k gives a shorter path
3. Update distances if shorter path is found
4. Repeat for all vertices

**Key Concept:** Dynamic Programming - builds solution by solving smaller subproblems

**Algorithm Complexity:**

### Problem 7b: 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming)
**File:** [problem 7 b).cpp](problem 7 b).cpp)

**What it does:**  
Solves the knapsack problem where you must take whole items (no fractions) to maximize value.

**Real-world analogy:**  
Like packing a backpack with whole items (you can't cut a laptop in half) to get maximum value while staying under weight limit.

**Algorithm Used:** Dynamic Programming

**How it works:**
1. Create a table where each cell represents "maximum value with i items and weight w"
2. For each item, decide: include it or exclude it
3. Choose the option that gives maximum value
4. Build up solution from smaller subproblems

**Key Difference from Problem 5:** Items cannot be fractioned; must take all or nothing

**Algorithm Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(n × W) where n = items, W = capacity
- Space Complexity: O(n × W)

**Input Example:**
```
Enter number of items: 4
Enter profit of items:
60 100 120 80
Enter weights of items:

### Problem 8a: N-Queens Problem
**File:** [problem8 a).cpp](problem8 a).cpp)

**What it does:**  
Solves the classic chess problem: place N queens on an N×N chessboard so no two queens attack each other.

**Real-world analogy:**  
Like placing security cameras in a grid where each camera can see its entire row, column, and diagonals - you need to position them so they don't overlap coverage.

**Algorithm Used:** Backtracking

**How it works:**
1. Place queens one row at a time
2. For each row, try placing queen in each column
3. Check if placement is safe (no conflicts)
4. If safe, move to next row
5. If stuck, backtrack and try different position

**Key Concept:** Backtracking - try a solution, if it doesn't work, undo and try another

**Algorithm Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(N!) - exponential, tries many combinations
- Space Complexity: O(N)

**Input Example:**
```
Enter number of queens: 4
```

**Output:** Shows all possible board configurations

**Usage:**
```bash
g++ "problem8 a).cpp" -o problem8a

### Problem 8b: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
**File:** [problem 8 b).cpp](problem 8 b).cpp)

**What it does:**  
Finds the longest sequence of characters that appear in the same order in two strings (but not necessarily consecutively).

**Real-world analogy:**  
Like finding common features between two DNA sequences, or detecting plagiarism by finding matching patterns in documents.

**Algorithm Used:** Dynamic Programming

**How it works:**
1. Create a table comparing each character of string 1 with string 2
2. If characters match, add 1 to diagonal value
3. If they don't match, take maximum from top or left
4. Trace back through table to reconstruct the LCS

**Example:**  
- String 1: "ABCDGH"
- String 2: "AEDFHR"
- LCS: "ADH" (appears in both in same order)

**Algorithm Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(m × n) where m, n are string lengths
- Space Complexity: O(m × n)

**Input Example:**
```
Enter first string: AGGTAB
Enter second string: GXTXAYB
```

## Advanced Algorithms

### Problem 9: 0/1 Knapsack (Backtracking)
**File:** [problem9.cpp](problem9.cpp)

**What it does:**  
Solves 0/1 knapsack using backtracking - tries all possible combinations to find the absolute best solution.

**Real-world analogy:**  
Like trying every possible combination of items in your backpack to find the one with maximum value, undoing choices that don't work.

**Algorithm Used:** Backtracking (Brute Force with Pruning)

**How it works:**
1. For each item, make two choices: include or exclude
2. Recursively try both options
3. Track the maximum profit found
4. Backtrack when weight exceeds capacity

**Difference from 7b:**  
- Problem 7b uses DP (efficient, stores results)
- Problem 9 uses backtracking (tries all combinations)

**Algorithm Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ) - exponential, tries all combinations
- Space Complexity: O(n) - recursion depth

**Input Example:**
```
Enter number of items: 4
Enter weights: 2 1 3 2

**File:** [problem10 a).cpp](problem10 a).cpp)

**What it does:**  
Finds the shortest route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

**Real-world analogy:**  
Like a delivery driver finding the most efficient route to deliver packages to all addresses and return home.

**Algorithm Used:** Branch and Bound with Matrix Reduction

**How it works:**
1. Create cost matrix of distances between cities
2. Reduce matrix (subtract minimum from each row/column)
3. Use priority queue to explore most promising paths first
4. Prune paths that can't possibly be better than current best
5. Build complete tour and find minimum cost

**Key Concept:** Branch and Bound - systematically explore options while pruning branches that can't lead to better solutions

**Algorithm Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(n!) in worst case, but much better with pruning
- Space Complexity: O(n²)

**Input Example:**
```
Enter number of cities: 4
Enter cost matrix (use 'i' or 'I' for infinity):
i 10 15 20
10 i 35 25
15 35 i 30
20 25 30 i
```

**Output:** Shows optimal tour and its cost with intermediate steps

**Usage:**
```bash
g++ "problem10 a).cpp" -o problem10a
./problem10a
```

---

### Problem 10b: 0/1 Knapsack - Branch and Bound
**File:** [problem 10 b).cpp](problem 10 b).cpp)

**What it does:**  
Solves 0/1 knapsack more efficiently than backtracking by pruning unpromising branches early.

**Real-world analogy:**  
Like smartly packing a backpack by first considering the most valuable items per weight, and skipping combinations that clearly won't beat your current best.

**Algorithm Used:** Branch and Bound with Fractional Bound

**How it works:**
1. Sort items by value-to-weight ratio
2. Use priority queue to explore most promising solutions first
3. Calculate upper bound (fractional knapsack) for each node
4. Prune branches where upper bound ≤ current best
5. Track best solution found

**Key Advantage:** Much faster than pure backtracking for large inputs

**Algorithm Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ) worst case, but typically much better
- Space Complexity: O(n)

**Input Example:**
```
Enter number of items: 4
Enter weights of items (space separated): 2 1 3 2
Enter values of items (space separated): 12 10 20 15
Enter knapsack capacity: 5
```

**Output:** Shows maximum profit and which items to include

**Usage:**
```bash
g++ "problem 10 b).cpp" -o problem10b
./problem10b
```


## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. **Time Complexity**
Measures how execution time grows with input size:
- **O(1)**: Constant - always same time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic - very fast, doubles work for exponential input growth
- **O(n)**: Linear - time grows directly with input
- **O(n log n)**: Efficient sorting algorithms
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic - slow for large inputs
- **O(2ⁿ)**: Exponential - very slow, avoid for large n

### 2. **Space Complexity**
Measures how much memory an algorithm needs

### 3. **Algorithm Paradigms**

**Divide and Conquer** (Programs 3b, 2):
- Break problem into smaller pieces
- Solve each piece
- Combine solutions

**Greedy** (Problems 5, 6, Program 4):
- Make locally optimal choice at each step
- Hope global optimum emerges
- Fast but doesn't always give best answer

**Dynamic Programming** (Problems 7a, 7b, 8b):
- Break into overlapping subproblems
- Store solutions to avoid recalculation
- Build up to final solution

**Backtracking** (Problems 8a, 9):
- Try building solution incrementally
- Undo (backtrack) when stuck
- Explore all possibilities

**Branch and Bound** (Problems 10a, 10b):
- Like backtracking but smarter
- Prune branches that can't improve solution
- Uses bounds to avoid unnecessary work

### 4. **Data Structures Used**

- **Arrays**: Linear collection of elements
- **Graphs**: Nodes connected by edges
- **Priority Queue**: Always gives smallest/largest element
- **Stack**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
- **Queue**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
